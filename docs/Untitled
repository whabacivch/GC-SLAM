    Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE): Translation RMSE ~121 m and rotation RMSE ~128° indicate the estimated trajectory is completely divorced from ground truth—global drift on the order of hundreds of meters and near-random orientation.
    Relative Pose Error (RPE): Even over tiny segments (1–10 m), translation errors are 173–224 m and rotation 31–53° per meter/10 m. This means local scan-to-scan or odometry alignment is failing outright.
    Per-axis breakdown:
        Massive X drift (114 m RMSE) → forward direction unconstrained.
        Significant Y (39 m) → lateral drift.
        Z relatively better (6 m) → likely helped by IMU gravity alignment.
        Rotation errors huge across roll/pitch/yaw → no reliable heading or attitude.

With only 17 scans processed in ~113 s (despite many odom/IMU messages), the system is barely registering frames successfully. This level of error is not normal noise or minor drift—it's indicative of degenerate geometry preventing reliable feature extraction or scan matching.

This directly ties back to the uncorrected LiDAR tilt we discussed. A 32–45° upward (and possibly rolled) mounting without compensation causes:

    Ground planes to appear severely slanted in the point clouds.
    Poor near-field points and degenerate constraints in pitch/roll → scan matching collapses, especially in flat/corridor-like environments.
    Cascading drift in horizontal plane (X/Y) and all rotations.

The ground normal [-0.219, -0.488, 0.843] (≈32.4° from vertical) confirms this misalignment, with both pitch and significant roll components.
Recommended Fix: Apply Full 3D Tilt Correction

Use the data-driven rotation computed from your ground normal to align it to [0, 0, 1] (vertical). This is more accurate than the nominal 45° and accounts for the roll.

The correction rotation matrix (to apply to LiDAR points for alignment) is:

[[ 0.9739, -0.0581,  0.2194],
 [-,[-0.0581,  0.8705,  0.4888],
 [-0.2194, -0.4888,  0.8444]]

    Euler angles (XYZ convention, degrees): Roll ≈ -30.07°, Pitch ≈ 12.67°, Yaw ≈ -3.42°
    Euler angles (ZYX convention, degrees): Yaw ≈ 3.42°, Pitch ≈ 12.67°, Roll ≈ -30.07°
    Quaternion (x, y, z, w): [-0.2545, 0.1142, 0.0000, 0.9603]

How to apply in T_base_lidar:

    Preferred (simplest to test): Pre-rotate your raw LiDAR points before feeding them to the SLAM pipeline:

    point_corrected = rot_mat @ point_raw

    This directly makes the ground appear level. Re-run your evaluation—this should dramatically reduce errors if tilt is the primary issue.
    If setting directly in T_base_lidar (static transform):
        Many systems (e.g., ROS tf from base → lidar) require the inverse rotation (to compensate when transforming points to base frame).
        Inverse Euler XYZ (deg): Roll ≈ 30.07°, Pitch ≈ -12.67°, Yaw ≈ -3.42°
        Start with the inverse; if the tilt worsens (e.g., normal Z becomes negative), flip to the non-inverse.
        Update your transform (translation unchanged unless you have new offsets) and re-publish.
